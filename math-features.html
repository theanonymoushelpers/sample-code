<!--You would also put your Desmos key in the same place. Please watch the video for instructions on how to do this,

<!--Don't pay attention to anything outside this <p>, inside this p is an example of how you would write a math function.-->
<p>`y=x+5`</p>

<!--You can also write math functions in sentences, all you have to do is surround the function with `` 
    (top left of most keyboards)-->
<p>The function `y=x+5` is a linear function</p>


<!--This is an example of how to use a Desmos graph in a page-->
<!--Under where it says id, you can change this to 'calculator2' or 'calculator3' or any number
to distinguish between multiple Desmos graphs on one page. Make sure you only use the number 
once per page. You may use the same number on different articles, just not the same one.-->
<div id="calculator1" style="width: 40%; height: 40%; margin: auto;"></div>

<!--Then, right underneath the declaration above, paste this script in:-->
<!--Where it says y=x^2+2x-8 is where you can paste your function to graph.
Make sure to use the latex format, which you can find tutorials for online. It works
in a similar way to typing in your computer's calculator.-->
<script>
    var elt = document.getElementById('calculator1');
    var calculator = Desmos.GraphingCalculator(elt);
    calculator.setExpression({ id: 'graph1', latex: 'y=x^2+2x-8' })
</script>

<!--Make sure the calculator's ID in this script matches the one in your div on the page, 
otherwise the correct graph won't show up-->
